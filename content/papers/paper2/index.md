##### Abstract

This paper addresses the challenge of inferring unknown unknowns—unmodelled errors and biases—in computational simulations through advanced data assimilation methods. The approach improves the accuracy of model predictions by estimating and correcting for hidden systematic errors. The methodology is demonstrated on relevant nonlinear dynamical systems relevant to engineering applications.
